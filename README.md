Test accuracy between 55% - 65% on average

Day 2 - changes made to optimizers and parameters to reduce model overfit

Day 3 - Tried to validate the model with images from internet ,but able to fifnd limited images only
  Split the datset into (75/25)csv format for easier access , previously(80/20)
  Testing accuracy on unseen data(given) reached a average of 90%
